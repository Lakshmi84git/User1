1.As per the given task I have completed my code as per the requirement with proper Framework Structure.
   The given Scenario:
				Create an in-memory store for recently played songs that can accommodate N songs per user,
				with a fixed initial capacity. This store must have the capability to store a list of song-user
				pairs, with each song linked to a user. It should also be able to fetch recently played songs
				based on the user and eliminate the least recently played songs when the store becomes full.

2.In Framework I have created one Maven Project and added all dependices,plugins in pom.xml file and also I have created 
Page Object Model,Test Cases with TestNG Tool.
    
3.After Automated the Script pushed to the Git with entire Framework.
